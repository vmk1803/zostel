# What did we Learn ?

- ### We were able to mimic basic functionalities on the website such as sign-in, signup, payment gateway, creating cloud database and post data using our own database, and fetch successfully, added different types of filters.
- ### There are a lot of things we took away from this experience apart from refining our coding capabilities, such as working in a team and our communications skills along with how to structure a project and distribution of tasks in a manner that will prove to be most fruitful.
